Burger Homework
------------------

This application uses express handlebars and mySQL.
------------------

It performs 3 simple tasks:

  1. Takes in information from the user and places that information within the sql database. This information is the burgers the user creates. 

  2. Displays each burger based on its state within the database. This state is the "devoured" state. 

  3. Lets the user change the state of each burger to and from "devoured".

---------------------

This is essentially a tech demo of the utility of sql databases having their information displayed through javascript when run by express, specifically handlebars.

NOW GO SMASH SOME BURGERS!
